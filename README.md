# Polynomial CalculatorðŸ§®

This repository contains a Polynomial Calculator project implemented in Java. The calculator supports various operations on polynomials, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Polynomial Addition**: Add two polynomials and return the resulting polynomial.
- **Polynomial Subtraction**: Subtract one polynomial from another and return the resulting polynomial.
- **Polynomial Multiplication**: Multiply two polynomials and return the resulting polynomial.
- **Polynomial Division**: Divide one polynomial by another and return the quotient and remainder polynomials.
- **Polynomial Evaluation**: Evaluate a polynomial at a given value of the variable.
- **Polynomial Differentiation**: Compute the derivative of a polynomial.
- **Polynomial Integration**: Compute the indefinite integral of a polynomial.

## Usage

1. **Polynomial Input**: Enter polynomials in the standard form, e.g., `3x^2 + 2x + 1`.
2. **Operation Selection**: Select the desired operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Evaluation, Differentiation, Integration).
3. **Result Display**: The result of the operation will be displayed on the screen.
